const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, developers will father all the specific details are required for a new system. This includes all software, hardware and network specifications and requirements for what they are building."

const design = "This is the third step, details for the overall application will be outlined. This can include User Interfaces, System Interfaces, and Databases."

const implementaton = "This is the fourth step. This is where you actually code and build the program in the language that has been chosen."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step. After the software has been written it will be tested for bugs and for a positive UI and UX. Once testing completes the software can be integrated or sent to the customer"

const maintain = " Last step. The software needs to be maintained. Any issues that arise after its implemented will need to be address and fixed while its live"
